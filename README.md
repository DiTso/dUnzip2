Pack and unpack files packed in ZIP archives
This package can be used to pack and unpack files in ZIP archives.

There is a class that can retrieve the list of packed files as well several types of file details, such as the uncompressed size, last modification time, comments, etc..

The class can extract individual files, one at a time, specifying their file names, or extract all at once into a given directory.

There is another class that can pack files into new ZIP archives.

The classes use the usual PHP file access functions and gzip extension functions.
